These projects showcase the real-life application of Box and how you can benefit from it.

## Box with Express

To see the real-life application of Box, check out this [TodoListApp](https://github.com/hacktivistic/box-todo) (*"Oh, another cliché Todo List App" is what you might be thinking, but come on what else can be a better example* 😉) on [GitHub](https://github.com/hacktivistic/box-todo).
